## Overview

Pokémon TCG is a console-based game developed in Java, inspired by the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG). The project focuses on creating a simple yet strategic turn-based battle system. Players can select their favorite Pokémon and challenge the computer opponent in an engaging card-based battle environment. The project demonstrates a strong understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) and game mechanics implementation.

## Key Features

- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Players and the computer take alternate turns, using moves to reduce the opponent's HP to zero and win the battle.
- **Pokemon Selection**: Players can choose from a list of Pokémon, each with unique stats and moves.
- **Battle Logic**: Developed with Java, featuring damage calculations based on Pokémon stats, moves, and type effectiveness.
- **Console Interface**: A text-based interface allows players to interact with the game through menus and commands.
- **Extensible Design**: The game is built with scalability in mind, making it easy to add new Pokémon, moves, and features in future updates.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: For implementing game logic, object-oriented design, and battle mechanics.
- **GitHub**: For hosting the source code and managing version control.
- **JUnit (Planned)**: For writing unit tests to ensure the reliability of battle logic and core functionalities.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was designing a flexible system to handle different Pokémon types, moves, and interactions. Implementing type-based damage multipliers and ensuring balanced gameplay required careful planning and testing. Additionally, creating a text-based interface that remains intuitive and engaging was another critical aspect of the project. Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of OOP principles and how to organize game systems efficiently.

## Outcome

The Pokémon TCG project offers a fun and strategic gaming experience in a console environment. It is an excellent demonstration of my Java programming skills and showcases the ability to implement game mechanics and scalable design principles. With potential future updates, such as adding more Pokémon or evolving the interface, the game could provide even more depth and replayability.
