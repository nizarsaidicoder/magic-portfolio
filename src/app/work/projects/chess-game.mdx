## Overview

This project is a minimalist chess game developed using Vue.js, focusing on simplicity and intuitive user interaction. Designed for local multiplayer gameplay, the chessboard interface and functionality were implemented with precision to deliver a seamless experience for users playing on the same device. The goal of the project is to evolve from its current state into a more dynamic application by incorporating AI for single-player mode and a multiplayer feature for online matches.

## Key Features

- **Local Multiplayer Mode** : Players can challenge each other on the same device, with a clean and responsive chessboard interface.
- **Minimalist Design** : A simple, distraction-free design that focuses on the game experience.
- **Vue.js Implementation** : The game leverages Vue.js for dynamic rendering and seamless user interaction, ensuring high performance and scalability for future enhancements.
- **Planned AI Integration** : Working on incorporating an AI opponent with adjustable difficulty levels, powered by chess engines like Stockfish.
- **Upcoming Online Multiplayer** : Plans to implement online gameplay using WebSockets or similar technologies to connect players globally.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js** : For building the game's front-end, ensuring a reactive and efficient user experience.
- **HTML5 and CSS3** : To create a clean and responsive interface.
- **JavaScript** : For implementing chess logic, move validation, and board state management.
- **Node.js (Planned)** : To power the backend for the online multiplayer feature.
- **WebSockets (Planned)** : For real-time communication between players in online matches.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the key challenges was implementing chess logic, particularly move validation for special rules such as castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. Optimizing the rendering of the board and pieces to ensure smooth gameplay was another important aspect. Additionally, planning the AI integration posed interesting questions about balancing performance and accuracy. These challenges provided an opportunity to deepen my understanding of chess algorithms and Vue.js state management.

## Outcome

The local chess game provides a polished and enjoyable experience for players on the same device. Its minimalist approach makes it accessible to both casual players and chess enthusiasts. Once AI opponents and online multiplayer features are added, the game will evolve into a more versatile platform, offering players multiple ways to engage with chess.
