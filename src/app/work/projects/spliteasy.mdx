## Overview

**SplitEasy** is a **work in progress** full-stack application aimed at simplifying how groups manage shared expenses. Inspired by Splitwise, it enables users to split costs, track who owes what, and settle up smoothly — all with a fast, responsive, and elegant UI.

This project is built from the ground up without boilerplate, focusing on clean architecture, real-time features, and high code quality across both the **backend** and **frontend**.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Group Expense Tracking**: Create groups and log shared expenses with different split methods (equally, percentages, custom amounts).
- **Balance Calculation**: Real-time updates on who owes whom, with automatic debt minimization logic.
- **Settle Up System**: Track repayments and keep balances accurate.
- **Cross-Platform App**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS using Expo.
- **Authentication**: Secure user login system with JWT.
- **Smart Notifications**: Get notified when someone adds an expense or settles a debt (coming soon).

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS (TypeScript)**: Robust and scalable backend architecture with REST APIs.
- **Prisma + PostgreSQL**: For relational data modeling and high-performance queries.
- **Expo (React Native)**: For a modern and native-like mobile app on iOS and Android.
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure and reliable user auth.
- **Tailwind CSS (via NativeWind)**: For rapid and responsive UI styling on mobile.
- **Zod**: Schema validation to keep data safe and structured.
- **Jest** (planned): For unit testing backend logic.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a cross-platform full-stack app from scratch has brought many challenges, including designing a scalable data model for group expenses, handling real-time balance updates, and ensuring frontend-backend sync. Using **NestJS with Prisma** has helped enforce clean architecture, while **Expo** made mobile development faster, though not without debugging quirks.

## Current Status

SplitEasy is actively in development. Core backend features and data models are operational. The frontend UI and user flows are being integrated progressively. Key priorities next include debt minimization logic, transaction history, and settlement handling.

Stay tuned for more updates as the app progresses toward a public beta!
