## Overview

**T4** is a **serious game** created during a 3-day sprint by a team of four students. It immerses players in the role of an architect tasked with designing buildings in **Antarctica**â€”one of the harshest environments on Earth. Each decision impacts not only the structural integrity of the architecture but also the **satisfaction of the inhabitants**. The game emphasizes environmental awareness and sustainable design principles while offering a level-based progression system that rewards thoughtful planning.

Developed as a web app using **Nuxt.js**, the game focuses on interactive button-based choices that simulate architectural challenges. The aim was to provide an educational yet engaging experience that highlights the importance of good architectural decisions in extreme climates.

## Key Features

- **Decision-Based Gameplay** : Players choose between architectural actions that influence satisfaction, comfort, and sustainability.
- **Inhabitant Feedback System** : Every decision affects the morale and well-being of the community.
- **Level Progression** : Multiple levels introduce new environmental constraints and architectural challenges.
- **Minimalist UI** : A clean, interactive interface makes it easy to focus on choices and their consequences.
- **Educational Value** : Promotes awareness of architectural ethics, environmental constraints, and user-centered design in hostile climates.
- **Team-Collaboration Project** : Built in 3 days by a group of 4, highlighting fast prototyping and strong teamwork.

## Technologies Used

- **Nuxt.js** : Framework used to build the frontend, offering a smooth SPA experience with Vue at its core.
- **Vue.js** : Underlying reactive framework for dynamic interface logic.
- **JavaScript** : Core language for gameplay logic and state handling.
- **HTML5 & CSS3** : For layout structure and clean design.
- **Git & GitHub** : For source control and collaboration during rapid development.

## Challenges and Learnings

This project was an intense learning experience in both **technical execution and team dynamics**:

- **Time Constraint** : Designing and building a full game in 3 days required careful scope management and clear task division.
- **User Experience** : Designing an interface that clearly communicates consequences and feedback to the player was a core UX challenge.
- **Satisfaction Mechanics** : Implementing a meaningful way to represent and update inhabitant satisfaction based on architectural choices required creative game design thinking.
- **Environmental Context** : Balancing realism (cold, resources, comfort) with fun and simplicity taught valuable lessons in gamification and abstraction.

## Outcome

T4 successfully demonstrates how games can be used to convey complex ideas like sustainable architecture and environmental ethics. Through a streamlined, level-based design and clear inhabitant feedback, players gain insight into the delicate balance architects must strike in extreme environments. The rapid development cycle also showcased the teamâ€™s ability to deliver a functional and educational game under pressure.
