Every once in a while, you experience something that reminds you why you fell in love with computer science in the first place. For me, that moment was **Les 24 Heures des IUT Informatique**—a thrilling, nationwide competition that challenged our skills, stamina, and creativity over a nonstop 24-hour coding marathon.

Held on **May 23–24, 2025**, this prestigious event brought together the best and brightest students from **BUT Informatique programs across France**. Hosted this year by **Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1**, it turned a quiet campus into a buzzing hub of problem-solving energy, filled with keyboards clacking, whiteboards filling up, and minds racing against the clock.

## Our Team: Les Tartelettes aux framboises 🍓

Yes, we were bold enough to go with a sweet name (It's the department chief who chose it). _Les Tartelettes aux framboises_ was our four-person squad representing our IUT, and we weren’t there just to play it safe—we were there to **make a mark**.

We knew the stakes were high. The event is a melting pot of innovation, pushing students to apply everything they've learned in a real, high-pressure environment. But instead of playing it by the book, we decided to **embrace originality**, especially when it came to the **web challenge**.

## The Web Challenge: A Creative Detour

Most teams stuck to the given problem scope. We, on the other hand, **went slightly off-track… intentionally**. Why? Because we had an idea we believed in—something unique, fun, and technically exciting. It wasn’t the most conventional approach, but that’s what made it so fulfilling. The judges noticed the deviation, sure—but they also appreciated the creativity and polish behind it.

It cost us a few points in the overall ranking, but we have **zero regrets**. Our detour was a statement: sometimes innovation comes from taking the scenic route.

## 3rd in Cybersecurity: Our Proudest Win 🔐

Where we really shined was the **cybersecurity challenge**—an intense battle of logic, precision, and deep technical knowledge. From reverse engineering binaries to exploiting subtle logic flaws, it was a playground for anyone passionate about system-level thinking.

And we crushed it—**3rd place in cybersecurity**, out of dozens of highly competitive teams. That moment, when the results came in, felt like pure validation of the hours we’ve spent tinkering with CTFs, cracking systems (legally!), and mastering the craft.

## The Algorithms Challenge: A Test of Logic and Speed

The algorithms challenge was another beast entirely. It pushed us to our limits, testing our ability to think on our feet and optimize under pressure. We tackled complex problems that required not just coding skills but also a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures.
Like finding the shortest path in a labyrinth, or understanding how images are created from pixels (we had to dig deep into the binary representation of images). It was a mental marathon, but we thrived on the challenge. The adrenaline rush of solving a tough problem with seconds to spare is something every coder lives for.

## The Spirit of the 24H

What made this event truly unforgettable wasn’t just the competition—it was the **ambiance**. Imagine a room full of passionate students coding under pressure, sharing snacks and caffeine, cracking jokes at 4 AM, and pushing each other to do their best.

## Lessons Learned

- **Teamwork is everything**: Communication, role distribution, and mutual trust made all the difference.
- **Innovation > Conformity**: Even if it costs you points, originality stands out.
- **Preparation meets passion**: That's not true, we didn't prepare at all, but we had fun and learned a lot.

## The Takeaway

Les 24 Heures des IUT Informatique wasn’t just a competition—it was a **24-hour burst of growth, bonding, and boundless creativity**. We walked away tired but proud, more connected as a team, and inspired to keep building cool, impactful things.

To future participants: if you get the chance, **take it**. Push yourself. Experiment. Collaborate. And maybe, like us, you’ll come home with a trophy, great memories, and the feeling that you were part of something bigger than code.
